### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m data analyst with five years of experience aspired to get into software development. I have studied JS, styling and other tools for frontend development and I am glad for any experience that will help improve my skills as a programmer.

I am pretty aware it is not the easiest way of ninja, but it is worth it all to start my career there, constantly learning new technologies and making world a better place to live our simple lives and experience beautiful interfaces ðŸ˜Š
